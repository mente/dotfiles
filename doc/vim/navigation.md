* NERDTree - everyone's favorite tree browser
* NERDTree-tabs - makes NERDTree play nice with MacVim tabs so that it's on every tab
* ShowMarks - creates a visual gutter to the left of the number column showing you your marks
* EasyMotion - hit <kbd>,</kbd> <kbd>esc</kbd> (forward) or <kbd>,</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>Esc</kbd> (back) and watch the magic happen. Just type the letters and jump directly to your target - in the provided vimrc the keys are optimized for home row mostly. Using @skwp modified EasyMotion which uses vimperator-style two character targets.
* CtrlP - <kbd>,</kbd> <kbd>t</kbd> to find a file
* Visual-star-search - make the <kbd>*</kbd> (star) search in visual mode behave like expected: searching for the whole selection instead of just the word under the cursor.
* Ag - super fast search by Silver Searcher. hit <kbd>K</kbd> to grep current word
* vim-tmux-navigator - nagivate between vim and tmux splits in the same way you move between normal vim splits.
